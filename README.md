## 📁 Project Overview

This repository includes multiple case studies and Excel challenges focused on **sales analysis, customer churn analysis, and employee performance evaluation**. The goal is to develop skills in data analysis, visualization, and Excel automation while answering real-world business questions.

I have applied key **Excel functions, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and dashboard creation** to extract meaningful insights from datasets.

---

## 📈 Key Objectives

- Perform **sales revenue analysis** across regions.
- Analyze **customer churn trends** and retention.
- Evaluate **employee efficiency and performance**.
- Utilize **SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, INDEX-MATCH, LARGE, IF, and Pivot Tables** to solve analytical problems.
- Apply **data cleaning techniques** to fix messy datasets.
- Create **dynamic dashboards** for data visualization.

## 🛠️ Excel Functions & Techniques Learned

Throughout these case studies, I have used and refined the following Excel techniques:

### **🔢 Aggregation & Lookup Functions**
- `SUMIFS()`, `COUNTIFS()`, `AVERAGEIFS()` – for filtered data calculations.
- `INDEX()`, `MATCH()`, `LARGE()` – for advanced lookups and ranking.
- `IF()`, `IFERROR()` – for conditional logic.

### **🎨 Visualization & Formatting**
- **Pivot Tables & Slicers** – for interactive data exploration.
- **Conditional Formatting** – to highlight key insights (e.g., top sales, high efficiency).
- **Charts & Graphs** – bar charts, pie charts, and dashboards for reporting.

### **🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- `PROPER()`, `TRIM()`, `SUBSTITUTE()` – for cleaning inconsistent text formats.
- Removing extra spaces and standardizing phone numbers.

## 📊 Business Questions Answered

Here are the key questions tackled in this project:

### **📌 Case Study 1: Sales Data Analysis**
- What is the **total revenue by region**?
- How much **total sales did each Sales Rep generate**?
- Which are the **top 5 highest sales transactions**?
- How does **revenue compare across regions using bar charts**?

### **📌 Case Study 2: Customer Churn Analysis**
- How many customers are **active vs. churned**?
- What is the **average Monthly Plan value for churned customers**?
- Which customers **haven’t used the service in the last 6 months**?
- What is the **proportion of Active vs. Churned customers** in a pie chart?

### **📌 Case Study 3: Employee Performance Dashboard**
- How is **Efficiency (%)** calculated?
- Who is the **top-performing employee**?
- Which employees have **efficiency above 30%**?
- How can we create a **dynamic performance dashboard**?

## 💡 Excel Challenges Solved

### **📍 Formula Challenge**
- **Find the 3rd highest revenue transaction** using:
  ```excel
  =LARGE(Revenue_Column, 3)
📍 Data Cleaning Challenge
Fix inconsistent text formatting:
=PROPER(A2)   ' Capitalizes names properly
=TRIM(B2)     ' Removes extra spaces
=SUBSTITUTE(C2, "-", "")  ' Removes dashes from phone numbers
